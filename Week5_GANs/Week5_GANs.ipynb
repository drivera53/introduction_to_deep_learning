    "We recognize the works of artists through their unique style, such as color choices or brush strokes. The “je ne sais quoi” of artists like Claude Monet can now be imitated with algorithms thanks to generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this getting started competition, you will bring that style to your photos or recreate the style from scratch!\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer vision has advanced tremendously in recent years and GANs are now capable of mimicking objects in a very convincing way. But creating museum-worthy masterpieces is thought of to be, well, more art than science. So can (data) science, in the form of GANs, trick classifiers into believing you’ve created a true Monet? That’s the challenge you’ll take on!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge:\n",
    "A GAN consists of at least two neural networks: a generator model and a discriminator model. The generator is a neural network that creates the images. For our competition, you should generate images in the style of Monet. This generator is trained using a discriminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two models will work against each other, with the generator trying to trick the discriminator, and the discriminator trying to accurately classify the real vs. generated images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a GAN that generates 7,000 to 10,000 Monet-style images."

    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "The dataset contains four directories: `monet_tfrec`, `photo_tfrec`, `monet_jpg`, and `photo_jpg`. The `monet_tfrec` and `monet_jpg` directories contain the same painting images, and the `photo_tfrec` and `photo_jpg` directories contain the same photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using TFRecords as a Getting Started competition is a great way to become more familiar with a new data format, but JPEG images have also been provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `monet` directories contain Monet paintings. Use these images to train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `photo` directories contain photos. Add Monet-style to these images and submit your generated jpeg images as a zip file. Other photos outside of this dataset can be transformed but keep your submission file limited to 10,000 images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Monet-style art can be created from scratch using other GAN architectures like DCGAN. The submitted image files do not necessarily have to be transformed photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the [CycleGAN dataset](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN) to experiment with the artistic style of other artists.\n",

    "- **monet_tfrec** - 300 Monet paintings sized 256x256 in TFRecord format\n",
    "- **photo_jpg** - 7028 photos sized 256x256 in JPEG format\n",

    "## Submission format\n",
    "Your kernel's output must be called `images.zip` and contain 7,000-10,000 images sized 256x256."
